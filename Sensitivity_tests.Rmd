# Introduction

Friends of Casco Bay uses less accurate electrochemical pH sensors, rather than
the more expensive Field Effect Transistor sensors or colorimetric pH
technology. As a result, they measure pH in NBS pH Scale, not on the more
precise Total pH scale, as recommended by Pimenta and Greer 2018 (and many other
references).

> pH and Associated Carbonate Chemistry in Coastal Environments of the

> Washington, DC, EPA/600/R-17/483, 2018. 

Several references, however, suggest that for situations with substantial
differences in pCO~2~, such as estuarine environmetns, the potentiometric
approach using a glass electrode can provide adequate precision.

We want to explore the impact of apparently small changes in pH observations,
and by extension, other field measurements as collected by typical monitoring
programs might affect estimation of the other components of the carbonate
system, especially total alkalinity and Omega.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(seacarb)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(viridis)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
```

# Systematic Exploration of Error
## Create Mock Data
```{r mock_data}
ph        <- rep(seq(7.9, 8.1, 0.02), times =11)
pco2      <- rep(seq(350, 500, 15), each=11)

mock_data <- tibble(ph=ph, pco2=pco2, temp = 15, sal = 30)
```

## Calculate Carbonate Parameters
```{r carbonate_1}
carb_data = carb(flag = 21, mock_data$pco2, mock_data$ph, S=mock_data$sal,
                 T=mock_data$temp,
                 Patm=1, P=0, Pt=0, Sit=0,
                 k1k2="x", kf="x", ks="d", pHscale="T",
                 b="u74", gas="potential", 
                 warn="y", eos="eos80",
                 long=-69, lat=40)   # I don't think we need the lat and long....
```

## Graphical Display of Omega as a function of pH and PCO~2~
```{r graphic_1}
ggplot(carb_data, aes(x=pH, y=pCO2, z=OmegaAragonite)) +
  geom_contour_filled(color='white') +
  theme_cbep()
```
So, loosely speaking, an error of one tenth of a pH point can shift the
estimated omega value from roughly 0.9 or 1.0 to around 1.5.  To shift omega as
far based on an error measuring pCO~2~, you'd need to be "off" on your estimate
of pCO~2~ by around 150 micro Atmospheres.

# Varying Temperature and Salinity
```{r graphic_2}
temp        <- rep(seq(14, 16, 0.2), times =11)
sal      <- rep(seq(29, 31, 0.2), each=11)

mock_data <- tibble(ph=8.0, pco2=500, temp = temp, sal = sal)

carb_data = carb(flag = 21, mock_data$pco2, mock_data$ph,
                 S=mock_data$sal, T=mock_data$temp,
                 Patm=1, P=0, Pt=0, Sit=0,
                 k1k2="x", kf="x", ks="d", pHscale="T",
                 b="u74", gas="potential", 
                 warn="y", eos="eos80",
                 long=-69, lat=40)   # I don't think we need the lat and long....

ggplot(carb_data, aes(x=T, y=S, z=OmegaAragonite)) +
  geom_contour_filled(color='white') +
  theme_cbep()
```
While the shape looks similar, the scale is quite different.  Full scale here is
only a range of 0.3, less than 1/10th the scale of impact of potential errors in
pH.

Note that for a complete version of this I would need to explore the full
parameter space, rather than take selected two dimensional slices through it.
