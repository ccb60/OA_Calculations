# OA_Calculations
Explorations of Interrelationships among OA parameters based loosely on monitoring data from Casco Bay

In several settings, we have been finding apparent inconsistencies in how data
as observed in Casco Bay get converted behind the scenes to estimates of core
carbonate parameters.

We also have been uncertain about the sensitivity of omega sestimates on
accuracy of the core data that undergirds calculation of parameters of the
CO~2~ system.

Here we will have two R Notebooks:
1. the first  uses selected data from Casco Bay to check of FOCB and UNH
are  calculating OA parameters the same way or not.

2. A notebook that explores sensitivity of Omega estimates based on variation
("error" ) in each parameter.
