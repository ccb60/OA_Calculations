# Data Notes

All data derived from CBEP_OA and FOCB_Data repository data files. See those
repositories for additional detail.

Data was selected only for summer and fall of 2016then columns were 
reordered so order was similat between the two files.

Note that the two files use different pH scales.  FOCB used the NBS pH scale,
while data from UNH uses the Total pH scale. (90% certai I have that right....).

there appears to be no direct method for converting between the potentiaometric 
nbs pH scale and Total pH scale

One representative on-line source had the following to say:
> Potentiometric measurements of pH are inherently less precise than
> spectrophotometric measurements. Moreover, the relationship between the NBS
> Scale and the Total Scale is not exact and depends on characteristics of the
> electrode employed.

That's great, as far as it goes, but it is problematic with regards to comparing
pH observations at different locations. I do not know whether I should consider
the NBS observations high, low, or just noisier than the Total pH measurements.
